### WARNING :warning: 

- First of all, you need to download our pictures folder : https://we.tl/t-RBMxmTlq58 (wetranfer link)
- And place it at the right path : app/pictures
- Otherwise it won't work (we had no other choice, it's too heavy files for GitHub)

### Running the app

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Open `socket.contextjs` and change the `IP` at the top of the file.
3. Start the app with `npm i` and `npx expo start` in yam-live-G1 and `npm start` in backend.
